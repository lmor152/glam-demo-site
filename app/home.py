I created GLAM (Geocoding via LINZ Address Matching) to help with geocoding New Zealand addresses.

GLAM is a tool for ***free, offline*** geocoding. It works by matching addresses to Land Information New Zealand data, so it only works with residential addresses. 

GLAM includes multiple methods for parsing and matching messy unstructured addresses. Find out more here: https://github.com/lmor152/glam

GLAM is designed to handle messy addresses, this includes building names, levels, abbreviations, and typos. 

Test it out by entering an address, and seeing how it parses the address components and finds the best match in the LINZ database.
